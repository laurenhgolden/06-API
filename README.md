# 06-API

Using the starter code, referencing classwork samples and working with AskBCS my instructor, I worked through the code part by part.
First I manipulated my randomly generated city data to create a paired down data frame and plot visualizations of different weather data
for these cities. Then I narrowed this data down further to "ideal" vacation locations and plotted them on a visual map.
If you have any questions or concerns, please let me know.
